# app

## setup

In Sublime install package `Ethereum` to see the highlights.

## docker to the rescue

```bash
docker-compose up -d && docker-compose exec js ash

# how we init project 
$ yarn init
# but the package.json is already there for now :)

# so better
$ yarn start
```

## compile

Solidity compiler to get ABI + Bytecode and deploy it in the real network.
